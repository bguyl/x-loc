    1: "This one's for all you greenhorns out there: chop wood and search for wild forage to earn some cash while waiting on your first harvest!" #!String
    4: "This one's for you folks living in Stardew Valley. Check for spring onion southwest of town, where the river meets the ocean. You can sometimes find a whole bunch growing right out of the dirt." #!String
    8: "Let's talk fences. Fences are useful for keeping weeds at bay and protecting your crops. They also let farmers contain their livestock. Fences break down after a while, but stone, iron, and hardwood fences last a lot longer than basic wood!" #!String
    11: "Woes from crows? Sounds like you need a scarecrow! Placing a scarecrow on your farm deters crows from a pretty good distance. Make sure you protect your valuable crops!^One more thing... need a bigger backpack to hold all your stuff? Check your local general store." #!String
    15: "It's salmonberry season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash." #!String
    18: "Ah, refreshing rain... a Farmer's best friend! When it rains, you don't have to water your crops. Use this to your advantage!" #!String
    22: "Get your hands on a fishin' pole and sell your catch! Fishing is a great way to make a little extra cash when you have some down time. The distance your bobber lands from any dry land determines what kinds of fish you'll hook... as well as the location, season, time of day, and weather!" #!String
    25: "Fruit trees. They take an entire season to grow, so plan ahead! If the area directly surrounding your new tree isn't clear, it will interfere with growth. Once your fruit tree is mature, it'll produce delicious fruit for you every day while in season. Better start savin' up!" #!String
    29: "Summer's here, along with a whole slew of new crops to plant! Take hops, for example. The vines take a while to grow, but once they're mature they can be harvested every day. Good luck!" #!String
    32: "Here's a rundown of the fish you can only find in summer: Dorado, found in forest rivers during the day. Rainbow Trout, found in forest rivers and in the mountains during the day. Pufferfish, found in the ocean in the early afternoon. And Octopus, found in the ocean during the morning. Catch them while you can!" #!String
    36: "Let's talk corn. It's an unusual crop because it lasts for two seasons! That's right, while most crops die when the season changes, corn lives on. You can grow it in both summer and fall. Now, get out there and plant some corn!" #!String
    39: "Starting tomorrow, an unusual amount of shells and corals are expected to wash up on beaches all around the world. I'm no scientist, but I've heard it's something to do with crab mating season. At any rate, you could make some good coin combing your local beach." #!String
    43: "Got a spa in your town? Relax and hold still in the steaming hot water to replenish your energy. Ahh... feels good, don't it?" #!String

    50: "Most towns have a seasonal calendar in front of the general store. It's a good idea to check on that now and then to get a feel for what's going on in the community. Make sure to check for any job postings as well!" #!String
    53: "Fall's almost here! It's arguably the most lucrative season for farmers, so make sure you're saving some money to buy new seeds. If you haven't upgraded your watering can by now, it's probably a good idea." #!String
    57: "Let's talk sunflowers. When you harvest them you'll not only get a nice flower, but you'll likely get some seeds as well. You can replant those seeds or sell them. I'm sold!" #!String
    60: "It's blackberry season! Bushes across the countryside are overflowing with ripe fruit. Just go outside and see for yourself!" #!String

    71: "Got any tappers? Crafty foragers known how to build 'em. You can attach them to the wild trees that grow all over. Maple trees yield maple syrup, oak trees provide resin, and pine trees produce pine tar. Syrup's the most valuable but all tree products have their uses!" #!String
    74: "Winter's almost here. Make sure you have enough hay stored up to feed your animals over the winter, when all the grass dies out. Each silo can hold 240 pieces of hay, so make sure to do the math and figure out if you need to build any more!" #!String
    78: "Fish Focus: Walleye. You can find this fish on rainy evenings during the fall and winter. It can be found in any freshwater location." #!String
    81: "Winter's coming soon... and that means your farming operations will be coming to a halt. No crops grow in winter, unless you're lucky enough to have a greenhouse. But there's still plenty to do! More next time." #!String

Or get your local carpenter to build something on your farm! Stock up on resources, upgrade, and prepare for the next year." #!String

    99: "Let's talk geodes. Geodes are hollow stones that often contain valuable minerals. A blacksmith can crack them open for you for a fee.

    102: "If you really want to make someone happy, give them their favorite gift on their birthday! Trust me." #!String
    106: "Ever see three little brown stems poking up out of the ground? They're hard to spot, sometimes. But if you dig on that spot, you'll always find something. Don't ask me how it works." #!String
    109: "Ever had the urge to dig around in your neighbor's trash? Ew! Hey, if that's your thing, just don't do it when anyone's around. If they notice you, they'll be seriously grossed out, and it'll harm your friendship. Well, unless they're into the same thing." #!String

    127: "It's salmonberry season! All across the countryside, bushes are teeming with juicy little berries, and they're free for the taking! Harvesting them is a great way to earn some extra cash." #!String
    130: "Let's talk honey. No, not you, silly. I'm talking about the sweet product made by our friends, the bees. Here's the thing... if you've got some flowers blooming near your beehouse your bees can produce flavored honey. Otherwise you'll only get 'wild honey'. Pretty sweet, huh?" #!String
    134: "Here's a tip for you adventurers out there... don't forget your weapon's special attack! Swords can block incoming attacks, which is very useful when slimes are jumping at you. Clubs can pound the ground, sending enemies flying... and with a dagger you can perform a super-quick triple-strike attack! Be safe." #!String
