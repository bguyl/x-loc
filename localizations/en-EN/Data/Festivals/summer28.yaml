    Demetrius: "The 'Moonlight Jelly'... what a remarkable species! We're very lucky that they stop here on their long journey south.#$e#It's unknown why they are attracted to light... very curious." #!String
    Maru: "It's kind of cold, actually. I guess fall is right around the corner." #!String
    Sebastian: "I thought I saw something moving in there... something big, something dark.#$e#Just trying to scare you...$h" #!String

    Wizard: "How did you find me back here? I thought I was well-hidden.#$b#Perhaps you are blessed with the gift of clairvoyance.#$e#I'm here to observe the Lunaloos... or 'Moonlight Jellies', as you call them. They possess an unusually potent magical aura for an aquatic life form." #!String
